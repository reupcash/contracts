REUP is a real-estate backed stablecoin project


=== TOKENS ==============================

--- REUSD
The stablecoin is REUSD.

REUSD will be backed 100% by a combination of:
    - The acquisition cost of a basket of income-producing real estate properties
    - Other stablecoins, held in the RECustodian contract until they're used to purchase more real estate

As a property's value increases over time, we do not revalue it to mint more REUSD.  Instead, REUSD simply 
becomes more than 100% backed.

REUSD can be minted by users (or the zapper) 1:1 for other stablecoins.

--- REYIELD
A reward token.  Yields collected from real estate income are distributed to REYIELD holders.

--- REUP
A reward token, but no plans have yet been announced.  It's currently a plain ERC20, however it might be
converted to a self-staking ERC20 (like REYIELD) via contract upgrade at some point.


=== FLOW ================================

Users will provide liquidity to a REUSD+3CRV curve pool (using a zapper to do it in a single transaction)

The gauge for the pool will pay:
    REYIELD
    USDC [based on the amount of REYIELD rewards the gauge has not yet distributed]
    CRV (if approved)

The REYIELD accumulated by users will also pay USDC to holders, without any need to stake.

People who wish to exit the project will be able to get stablecoins from the curve pool.  If too many people
take traditional stablecoins like USDC rather than REUSD, the pool will become unbalanced, and REUSD will
become "cheaper".  However, we would expect the condition to be temporary and self-correcting, as people
buy up the "cheap" REUSD until the pool has rebalanced.  If the entire ecosystem loses interest in our
project and there is a sustained imbalance, then we would begin to sell the real-estate properties to
reimburse people who wish to exit, 1:1.
